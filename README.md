# InsuranceSample

This repo is meant to be a sample implementation of a website that handles some specific use case scenarios in relationship with an insurance process.

Here are some assumptions made based on the specs:

* The insurance cover percentage is based on the overall insured asset market value.
* Insurance policies held with customers are contracts that cannot be modified hence the need to copy the policy terms in a separate entity.
* Insurance policy price is the monthly premium that the customer needs to pay in the lifespan of the specific contract.
